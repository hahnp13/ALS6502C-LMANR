## Load in and read about the beall.webworms dataset. The variables of interest are the y-count of webworms, 
## spray- spray treatment, and lead-lead treatment. Don't worry about the block or other variables for now.

data("beall.webworms")
d1 <- beall.webworms
?beall.webworms  ## info about the beall.webworms dataset
head(d1) ## view data set

## examine plot of data
ggplot(d1, aes(x=spray, y=y, fill=lead)) + geom_violin(scale="width", adjust=2) + 
  geom_point(position = position_jitterdodge(jitter.width=.5, jitter.height=.1, dodge.width = 1), alpha=.1) 


## Q1. Do webworm counts follow a normal distribution? Does it seem close enough?

## Q2. Construct a linear model with y as the predictor and Spray*Lead as the predictors.
##     How are the residuals?

## Q3. Try a log-transformation of y. How are the residuals? How do the emmeans differ between the linear and log-linear model?

## Q4. Try a generalized linear model using a Poisson distribution. How are the residuals? 
##      How do the emmeans differ between the linear and log-linear models?
##      How do the SE differ between the linear and log-linear models?
##      Check overdispersion using 'check_overdispersion' from performance package



## Q5. Use the DHARMa package to simulate residuals.
       ## Note that you'll need to change the XXXX to your model name.
       ## Examine residuals for the three models you created in Q2-Q4.

library(DHARMa)
plot(simulateResiduals(ENTER_MODEL_NAME_HERE))

## Q6. Fit a model with a negative binomial distribution using glmmTMB() with family='nbinom2'
      ## Do does the AIC and residuals compare to the other models?
